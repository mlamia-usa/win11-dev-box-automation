# Windows 11 Workstation Automation - Project Specification

## Project Overview

This document outlines the specifications for the Windows 11 Workstation Automation project, a PowerShell DSC-based configuration management system for automating workstation setup and configuration.

## Project Goals

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Bootstrap script that downloads configuration from GitHub
- Basic DSC configuration for computer name only
- Local testing and validation

### Phase 2 (Future)
- Additional workstation settings (users, groups, software installation)
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Configuration validation

### Phase 3 (Future)
- Advanced DSC configurations
- Multi-environment support
- Configuration drift detection

### Phase 4 (Future)
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- Documentation generation

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **Bootstrap Script** (`Bootstrap-Workstation.ps1`)
   - Downloads configuration files from GitHub
   - Executes main configuration script
   - Handles errors and logging

2. **Configuration Data** (`WorkstationData.psd1`)
   - Contains workstation-specific settings
   - Structured data format for DSC consumption

3. **DSC Configuration** (`WorkstationConfiguration.ps1`)
   - PowerShell DSC configuration
   - Applies settings defined in data file

```

## Phase 1 Implementation Details

### Bootstrap Script Requirements

- Download configuration files from GitHub using raw.githubusercontent.com URLs
- Save files to `C:\Temp\WorkstationConfig\`
- Execute `WorkstationConfiguration.ps1`
- Basic error handling with try/catch blocks
- Logging to `C:\Windows\Temp\Bootstrap-[timestamp].log`
- Clear comments for each section
- Work when downloaded and executed from browser

### Configuration Data Structure

```powershell
@{
    ComputerName = "LAB-WIN11-01"
    # TODO: Add additional settings in Phase 2
    # Users = @()
    # Groups = @()
    # Software = @()
    # Services = @()
}
```

### DSC Configuration Requirements

- Read configuration from `WorkstationData.psd1`
- Set computer name only (Phase 1)
- Compile MOF file
- Apply configuration
- Clear comments explaining DSC concepts

## Testing Strategy

### Local Testing

1. Clone repository locally
2. Execute bootstrap script from local files
3. Verify configuration application
4. Check logs for errors

### Remote Testing

1. Push to GitHub repository
2. Download bootstrap script via URL
3. Execute on target workstation
4. Verify configuration application

## Error Handling

### Bootstrap Script

- Check internet connectivity
- Verify PowerShell version
- Validate downloaded files
- Handle execution policy issues
- Log all operations

### DSC Configuration

- Validate configuration data
- Handle DSC compilation errors
- Manage configuration application failures
- Provide clear error messages

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for all downloads
- Validate downloaded files
- Run with appropriate privileges
- Log all operations for audit

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features

- User account management
- Group membership configuration
- Software installation
- Service configuration
- Registry settings

### Phase 3 Features

- Advanced DSC configurations
- Multi-environment support
- Configuration drift detection
- Automated testing

### Phase 4 Features

- CI/CD integration
- Automated documentation
- Performance monitoring
- Compliance reporting

## Dependencies

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Windows 11
- Internet connectivity
- Administrative privileges
- DSC modules (included with Windows)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1

- [ ] Bootstrap script downloads configuration successfully
- [ ] Computer name is set correctly
- [ ] Configuration is applied without errors
- [ ] Logging works properly
- [ ] Local testing passes
- [ ] Remote testing passes

### Future Phases

- [ ] Additional settings can be configured
- [ ] Multi-environment support works
- [ ] CI/CD integration is functional
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Notes

This specification will be updated as the project evolves through different phases. The current focus is on Phase 1 implementation with basic computer name configuration.
